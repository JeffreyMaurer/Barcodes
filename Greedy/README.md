I realized that Brute isn't true Brute, so I'm moving everything over here and then changing brute to actually be Brute force.

I was curious about what the maximum size of quaternary library could be given a specified number of deletions allowed. Brute force is not the way to go for scale up, but it gives us a good idea of what our upper limits are for this project.

This was written in C++ by me, Jeffrey Maurer, before 2/14/2017 in VS 2013.
