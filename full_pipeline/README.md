This is the full pipeline and the complete work of mine for Dr. Nguyen at Rowan University between summer of 2015 and summer of 2017. I wrote the entirety of the code. 

The entire purpose is to produce quaternary codes, strings with four given possibilities grouped into sets that are different from each other such that small mutations of one of the members of the set do not cause the mutated string to be inferred to be from a string in the set that was not its original string.
