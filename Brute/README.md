I was curious about what the maximum size of quaternary library could be given a specified number of deletions allowed. Brute force is not the way to go for scale up, but it gives us a good idea of what our upper limits are for this project.

This was written in C++ by me, Jeffrey Maurer, before 2/14/2017 in VS 2013.

Brute directory was editted on 6/3/2020. The Brute/Pure directory contains the basic brute force algorithm and has been shown to work. The Brute directory has a modified version that is slower, but doesn't use as much memory.
